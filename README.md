# Nupp(ka)

Nupp is application made for tracking macro nutrients and costs of diet plans, listing various products with detailed macronutrients and creating diet plans, recipes and many more.

Goal of my Nupp is to help you spend less, eat healthier, organize and improve your eating habits.

## Current State

**Currently**
Current State of application and what needs to be done in Frontend and in Backend is in respective folders.

At the moment I am learning redux and docker and frontend will be using redux therefor development of app slowed down pretty much but soon I will pick it back up.

I will share project brief, link to wireframes, link to design and also database schemas here.
