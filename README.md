# Nupp(ka)

Nupp is application made for tracking macro nutrients and costs of diet plans, listing various products with detailed macronutrients and creating diet plans, recipes and many more.

Goal of my Nupp is to help you spend less, eat healthier, organize and improve your eating habits.

## Current State

Application is at the beginning. 
I want to explore whole proccess of making web application that means:
 -  Project brief
 -  UX design / Wireframes
 -  UI design / Mockups
 -  Designing Database schemas
 -  Coding
 -  Server administration / maintenance

I will share project brief, link to wireframes, link to design and also database schemas here.

Keep in mind I am pre-junior developer, I have no corporate experience so there may be lot of mistakes, but hey, without mistakes there's no progress. :smirk:
